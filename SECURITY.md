# Security Policy

Please report security issues privately to security@your-org.example. We will acknowledge within 24 hours.

This project enforces CI security gates per `security/policy/ci-security-gates.yaml` and aligns to OWASP ASVS controls for authentication, authorization, validation, and configuration hardening.

Public disclosure should occur only after a coordinated fix and release.

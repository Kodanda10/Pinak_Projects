# Pinak - The Local-First AI Assistant for Developers

![Pinak Sync Image](pinak-sync.png)

Pinak is evolving into a cutting-edge, ultra-modern, and highly efficient local-first AI assistant, designed to empower developers with unparalleled capabilities in AI memory, security auditing, CLI interaction logging, and real-time context orchestration. Our vision is to build a world-class macOS application that sets new standards for developer tools, maintaining excellence akin to leading technology companies.

## Core Capabilities

### 🧠 AI Memory Service

Pinak provides a robust AI memory service that allows developers to store, manage, and semantically search through their knowledge. This service is designed for efficient retrieval of information, enabling developers to quickly access relevant code snippets, documentation, decisions, and insights.

*   **Semantic Search:** Leverage advanced vector embeddings and similarity search for intelligent information retrieval.
*   **Local-First Storage:** Data is stored locally, ensuring privacy, speed, and offline accessibility.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Built to handle vast amounts of developer knowledge with efficient indexing and retrieval mechanisms.

### 🔒 Security Auditor

Pinak integrates powerful security auditing capabilities directly into the developer workflow. It helps identify and mitigate security risks early in the development cycle.

*   **Secret Scanning:** Detect hardcoded secrets and sensitive information within your codebase.
*   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports of security findings for quick remediation.

### 💻 CLI Interaction Logging

Gain unprecedented insight and auditability into your command-line activities. Pinak captures and stores every command executed, along with its context, enabling fast search, replay, and analysis of past sessions.

*   **Full Command Capture:** Records commands, arguments, timestamps, exit codes, and environment context.
*   **Privacy-First Redaction:** Automatically redacts sensitive information to ensure data privacy.
*   **Session Replay:** Replay past CLI sessions for debugging, learning, or auditing purposes.

### 💡 Pinakontext - SOTA Context Orchestrator

Pinakontext is the intelligence layer that brings all of Pinak's capabilities together, providing real-time, on-demand, and nudge-based context to developers and AI agents. It surfaces the *right* information at the *moment of need*.

*   **Realtime Context Delivery:** Get proactive tips and relevant information during critical development events (e.g., build failures, flaky tests, PR reviews).
*   **Hybrid Retrieval & Ranking:** Combines semantic and keyword search with intelligent reranking for highly relevant results.
*   **Policy-Driven Context:** Ensures that context delivery adheres to defined security and access policies.
*   **Extensible Recipes:** Define custom context scenarios using a flexible YAML-based DSL.

## Our Commitment to Excellence

We are committed to building Pinak with the highest standards:

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ensuring robust and maintainable code.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** For automated testing, quality assurance, and continuous delivery.
*   **Regular GitHub Updates:** Maintaining a transparent and up-to-date codebase.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Providing clear and accessible documentation for all features.
*   **No File Deletion Policy:** Critical files are archived, not deleted, ensuring data integrity.
*   **MacOS App Excellence:** Every design and implementation decision is made with the goal of a world-class macOS application.

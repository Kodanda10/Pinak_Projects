## Gemini Added Memories

- **Project Vision:** Pinak is evolving into a world-class, SOTA, enterprise-grade macOS application (Pinak Bridge), empowering developers with unparalleled AI memory, security auditing, and real-time, on-demand, and nudge-based context orchestration capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Roadmap:** A detailed, phased roadmap has been approved, encompassing enhancements to the Memory Service, Security Auditor, introduction of CLI Interaction Logging, and the new Pinakontext Context Orchestrator.
- **Core Development Principles (Non-Negotiable):**
    - **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Strict adherence to TDD for all development.
    - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Central to the development workflow.
    - **GitHub Repository & Documentation Updates:** Meticulously updated throughout development.
    - **File Management Policy:** No file deletion; unused files moved to a local archive with reason.
    - **MacOS App Excellence:** Every decision aims for FANG/Apple levels of excellence.
- **New Rule for Gemini (Effective Immediately):**
    - **No `replace` or `old_string`:** Do not use the `replace` tool or rely on `old_string` matching. Instead, directly overwrite file content or archive the old file and create a new, rectified one.
    - **Fail Twice, Ask for Assistance (DebugPro Mode):** If a test fails twice on the same issue, stop, outline the core issue internally, conduct web search for the problem, outline 3 new/fresh approaches to overcome the challenge/issue, implement fixes, and move on to the next step.
- **User understands Pinak is a knowledge base, not a session logging tool.**
- **User requested a checkpoint. Current task: Fixing test_orchestrator.py. Last action: Attempted to fix SyntaxError in generated test file, but encountered another SyntaxError due to unescaped triple quotes within the Python string literal in the bash script. Next step: Correct the bash script to properly escape triple quotes and re-run.**

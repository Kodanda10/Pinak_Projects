# Development Log - Pinak Project

## 2025-08-28 - Initiating SOTA, Enterprise-Grade Roadmap

**Vision:** To transform Pinak into a world-class, SOTA, enterprise-grade macOS application (Pinak Bridge), empowering developers with unparalleled AI memory, security auditing, and real-time context orchestration.

**Approved Roadmap:** The comprehensive roadmap, integrating Memory Service enhancements, Security Auditor improvements, CLI Interaction Logging, and the new Pinakontext Context Orchestrator, has been approved. This roadmap is structured into three phases: Core Intelligence & Robustness, Advanced Intelligence & Enterprise Readiness, and World-Beater & Ecosystem.

**Core Development Principles (Non-Negotiable):**
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** All development will strictly adhere to TDD principles.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery will be central to the development workflow.
*   **GitHub Repository & Documentation Updates:** The GitHub repository and all relevant documentation will be kept meticulously updated throughout the development process.
*   **File Management Policy:** A strict policy of 'no file deletion' is in effect. Unused files will be moved to a local archive folder with a clear reason for archiving.
*   **MacOS App Excellence:** Every design and implementation decision will be made with the end goal of a world-class macOS application in mind, maintaining FANG and Apple levels of excellence.

**Current Focus:** Initial setup and documentation updates before commencing code development for Phase 1 features.

**Next Action:** Update `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new vision and roadmap.
